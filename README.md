# cnping-android

Android port of graphic ping tool [cnping](https://github.com/cnlohr/cnping)

**WORK IN PROGRESS! DO NOT TRY AT HOME!**

If you are android developer and have some time, I would be glad to hear some words about what I did wrong :)

## My changes
- Convert project to Android Studio format
- Add support for Android 9 and Magisk
- Add icon and App name

## TODO
- [ ] UI fool proofing
- [x] View resize support (including orientation change)
- [ ] Parameters (packet size, ping period)
- [ ] Performance fixes
- [ ] Testing on different devices
